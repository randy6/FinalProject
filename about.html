    <p1>Welcome to our Optimized Weekly Planner!</p1><br><br>
    <p1>This program allows users to create unique accounts in order to access our Full Access Weekly Planner. If users do not wish to create an account, they may use the public Guest Planner.</p1><br><br>
    <p1>Accounts are created along with a display name and a bio! These are unique to your account and can be viewed through the Account Details tab. Only you can view your specific information.</p1><br><br>
    <p1>Once signed up and logged in, users will have the option to use the Full Access Weekly Planner and create/delete To-do lists. These to-do lists are our dynamic data source and are stored in the backend.</p1><br><br>
    <p1>To do lists can be viewed by anybody who is logged in. Once created, to-do lists are stored until they are deleted from the backend by pressing the Delete All to-do lists button.</p1><br><br>
    <p1>If you are logged in, The Full Access Weekly Planner button will take you to a weekly planner that is complete with a 3rd-party weather api and autocomplete.</p1><br><br>
    <p1>Here, the user can put their to-do lists on a weekly schedule to make easy sense of tasks at hand!</p1><br><br>
    <p1>Have fun planning! </p1><br><br>
